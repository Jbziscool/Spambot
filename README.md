Spamming friends is fun

CustomSpammer.py is probably the best to use - also please note that i am not that good at python so I am sorry if there are any bugs or its not very good.

feel free to edit or do whatever.

If you encounter errors then you can ask in the python help server although not sure if they will help if they consider it malicious

Please make sure pyautogui is installed - you can do this with python -M pip install pyautogui


Please make sure you switch windows quick enough or your gonna end up with random crap typed everywhere, when you type yes or y you have 5 seconds before it starts spamming
